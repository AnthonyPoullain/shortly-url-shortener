## üéØ Goals of this project

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## ‚öôÔ∏è My process

I wanted to develop this site as fast as possible while keeping true to the design. I worked out of images as I didn't have access to the Figma files.

### Built with:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## üìÉ Acknowledgments

Thanks to [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/) for providing the course material and project specifications.
