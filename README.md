## Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

I wanted to develop this site as fast as possible while keeping true to the design. I worked out of images as I didn't have access to the Figma files.

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## ðŸ“ƒ Acknowledgments
